			<h2>What <i>IS</i> a pangolin?</h2>
			<p>A Pangolin is an almost extinct animal that is considered a reptile, but actually a mammal.  It is completley covered in scales for protection against predators.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Why are they almost extinct?</h2>
			<p>These mammals are probably the most trafficked mammal in the world.  Although laws have been passes to protect them, they're still in danger.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>What's their diet?</h2>
			<p>They mostly eat insects, like ants, termites, larvae and more.  They pick up the insects with their sticky tongue and suck it in because they have no teeth.  They're tongues might be competing with frog's tongues in length; their tongues are REALLY long!</p>
